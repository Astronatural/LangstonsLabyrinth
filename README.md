## Welcome to the Labyrinth

:skull:

This application is designed for RPG Game Masters to run a specific type of encounter for their players.  It features a maze that moves around the players as they move around it.  

Besides the maze there are two tokens; a Blue Shield and a Red Skull.
These tokens are moved independently by arrow buttons.
There are no rules to Langstonâ€™s Labyrinth.  As the GM you set the pace as you see fit.
